üõ†Ô∏è STEP-BY-STEP: Free Timestamp with OpenTimestamps
------------------------------------

1. Go to https://opentimestamps.org

2. Drag and drop one of the original files (e.g., PraxPrime_Master_Backup_v1.zip)

3. It will generate a new file: 
   [your-file-name].ots

4. Save the .ots file in the same folder as your original file.
   Example: Save it as
   - PraxPrime_Master_Backup_v1.zip
   - PraxPrime_Master_Backup_v1.ots

5. Wait a few hours to a few days for full blockchain confirmation.

6. To VERIFY later, go back to the site and upload:
   - Your original file
   - The corresponding .ots file

OpenTimestamps will confirm the blockchain timestamp and prove that
you created that file at the moment you did.
